            <p class="card-text">Over the past four years I have gained alot of knowledge and with that come alot of projects. They all vary in difficulty, but the most difficult ones were in my computer science class. My sophomore year I went form typing one word per minute and not even knowing what programing was to figuring out what and how to write my little programs. </p>

            <p class="card-text">While this is True, I am really good at COD, it is more a representation of the social sense of humor I developed. This started in middle school but skyrocketed is high school. I became very comfortable around people and I started to like having good conversations with random strangers. I really came out of a shell and became the person I am today.</p>
